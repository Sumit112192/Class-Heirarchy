## Description
We are aiming to create a python script that can generate a class heirarchy tree of a library/program(written in python). Specifically the tree structure of your overall code by specifying inheritance in the classes, present in the program. 


#### Technologies

- Python
- networkx
- graphviz
- Unix command line tools (find, grep, xargs)

#### Installation
Installation of pip and python3

Install the following python packages.
```pip
pip install networkx
pip install pydot
```
We would also be needing the graphviz software for the script to run.

Install from [here](https://graphviz.org/download/)
## How To Use
git clone or download the python library from github you want to create Class Heirarchy diagram of.

Say I downloaded the manim library from github and moved the folder to the current folder where class_heeirarchy.py file exists.

Run
```bash
python class_heirarchy.py manim output
```
where manim is the folder containing all my .py files of the library and output is the output pdf name i.e output.pdf
