## Description
We are aiming to create a python script that can generate a heirarchy tree of the library. Specifically the tree structure of your overall code by specifying inheritance in the classes, present in the program. 


#### Technologies

- Latex 
- Various python libraries

# Thing to do in Class-Heirarchy
Things to learn and implement for now
- [ ] Getting info about classes from a py file.
- [ ] Know about some python latex packages
- [ ] Converting the classes info into a nested loop that can be read by latex forest package
- [ ] Create the required heirarchy tree from the nested loop using the latex library.

While learning new packages, our first approach is watching Youtube Videos, If that doesn't help we go through the documentation provided by the library communit.y 
Finally our last option is the source code, we have to read the source code of the library. 
But reading about it is too dificult and figuring about parent classes in OOPs is time confusing.
So, to solve this problem, We are aiming to create a python script that can generate a heirarchy tree of the library.

Currently We tried to create the [manim library](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) class heirarchy tree manually using latex. Since, it was done manually it took a lot of time and it is incomplete for now. 

Here's the [latex code](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qbjntfvhgkqk)
